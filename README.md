# inspiration for the application
This project was thought of by AJ and the inspiration comes from using Shopify and having a cleaner and easier system for tracking inventory. 

# The technologies used to build the application
This is a PERN application. It uses Heroku and includes Heroku-postgres-database.  The backend also included the use of pgadmin and draw.io for tracing, creating and maintaining the database.

# Bugs or unfinished functionality
- Wish we could have finished the at-home "proxy" creating a secure-key so that not just any front end can call our database and use it or mess it up with malicious intent. 
- Adding limit and offset to the application would definitely be needed for a large store inventory.  We had a decent amount at 200 pieces but a larger store would not want to load all products at once. 

# Our Database Layout to start
